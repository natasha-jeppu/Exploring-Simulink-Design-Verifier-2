# Exploring-Simulink-Design-Verifier-2
A Simulink Design Verifier applied to Autopilot Mode Transition

This is a validation of an Autopilot Mode Transition using Simulink Design Verifier. The requirements are given as tables. An equivalent model is created which represents this mode transition. This is validated using assertion in the SDV. The SDV is compared with random test runs against the same set of assertions. Matlab m files are provided to run the cases.
